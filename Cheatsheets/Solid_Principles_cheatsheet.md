The **SOLID principles** are a set of five design principles aimed at creating more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software systems. These principles help developers write code that is easier to maintain, extend, and refactor. Here's an overview of each principle:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   _A class should have only one reason to change._  
   This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility. If a class handles more than one responsibility, it becomes more difficult to maintain, as changes to one part of the class may affect other parts.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   _Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification._  
   This principle suggests that you should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its existing code. This is often achieved through inheritance or by using interfaces and abstractions.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   _Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program._  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. In other words, a subclass should be able to stand in for a parent class without altering the behavior of the system.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   _Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use._  
   Instead of creating large, general-purpose interfaces, it's better to create smaller, more specific interfaces that are tailored to the needs of the clients. This avoids "fat" interfaces that have more methods than any one client needs.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   _High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions._  
   This principle encourages the use of abstractions (e.g., interfaces) instead of tightly coupling classes to specific implementations. It ensures that high-level components are decoupled from low-level details, making systems more flexible and easier to modify or extend.

These principles, when applied together, lead to cleaner, more manageable, and scalable object-oriented designs.
